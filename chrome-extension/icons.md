# Extension Icons

Create the following icon files for your extension:

- `images/icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `images/icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `images/icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can use any image editor to create these icons with your preferred design.
For a simple placeholder, you could create colored squares with "YT" text.

Place all icon files in an `images` folder in the root of your extension.
